## Network

In mathematics,"networks" are often referred to as "graphs",and the mathematical field of graph
research is called "graph theory".

The basic elements in a network graph are nodes and edges. When constructing a network graph,the
objects are called "nodes" (vertices or nodes),and they are usually drawn as points; the connections
between nodes are called "edges" (edges). or links),and they are usually drawn as lines between
points.

We Can be divide into directed and undirected networks, weighted and unweighted networks according to the edges.

## Network in omics

Networks can represent various systems in the real world,and have many applications in biological
research,especially in systems biology: gene expression regulatory networks,metabolic
networks,ecosystem space networks,microbial co-occurrence networks,protein interaction networks,etc (Figure \@ref(fig:2-net)).
