[["stability.html", "Chapter 7 Stability 7.1 Robustness tests 7.2 Community stability", " Chapter 7 Stability It is very important to compare networks stability based on different groups. So MetaNet collects lots of methods to reflect the stability and complexity, these algorithms are coded using Parallel Computing which can be much faster. data(&quot;otutab&quot;,package = &quot;MetaNet&quot;) #extract three-group sub-nets hebing(otutab,metadata$Group)-&gt;otutab_G sub_net_par=extract_sub_net(co_net,otutab_G,save_net = &quot;subnet&quot;) ## [1] &quot;extracting&quot; ## [1] &quot;calculating topological indexes&quot; load(&quot;subnet.rda&quot;) names(sub_nets) ## [1] &quot;NS&quot; &quot;WS&quot; &quot;CS&quot; 7.1 Robustness tests Robustness tests of networks were done with natural connectivity as it can reflect the stability of networks (WU Jun (2010)). Specifically, natural connectivity was calculated after removing the nodes (remove five nodes from a network at one time until 70% of nodes disappear), and the downtrend level of natural connectivity indicated the connectivity performance of the network after being damaged to a certain extent. robust_test(sub_nets, partial = 0.5,step=10,reps=9,threads=1)-&gt;robust_res plot.robustness(robust_res,mode = 3) 7.2 Community stability Community stability can be characterized by various indexes, such as robustness, vulnerability and cohesion. Networks with higher robustness and lower vulnerability tend to be more stable (Yuan et al. (2021)). Also, community stability is commonly associated with negative interactions, and high percentage of negative correlations within communities is essential for maintaining a stable ecological system. 7.2.1 Robustness The robustness was regarded as when 50% of nodes were randomly removed and results were based on 100 repetitions of the simulation. robustness(sub_nets,keystone=F,reps=9,threads=1)-&gt;robustness_res plot.robust(robustness_res) 7.2.2 Vulnerability To evaluate the speed of disturbance spreading within a network, the global efficiency was regarded as the average of the efficiency over all pairs of nodes, which was calculated by the number of edges in the shortest path between paired nodes. The vulnerability, which reflected the relative contribution of each node to the globe efficiency, was represented by the maximal vulnerability of nodes in the network. vulnerability_res=vulnerability(sub_nets,threads = 1) plot.vulnerability(vulnerability_res) 7.2.3 Cohesion Cohesion was calculated to quantify the connectivity of microbial communities in each group. Cohesion contains both positive and negative cohesion values, which indicate that associations between taxa attributed to positive and negative species interactions as well as similarities and differences in niches of microbial taxa. Briefly, pairwise Pearson correlation matrix across taxa was calculated based on abundance-weighted matrix. After “taxa shuffle” null module-correcting with 200 simulations, average positive and negative correlations was calculated to get a connectedness matrix. Finally, positive and negative cohesions were calculated for each sample respectively by multiplying the abundance-weighted matrix and connectedness matrix. The absolute value of negative: positive cohesion is an important index for community stability. \\(cohesion=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{{\\rm abundance}_i\\times connectness}_i\\) Cohesion(otutab,reps =
