# (PART) iPhylo CLI {-}

# Overview

The iPhylo CLI is an offline command-line version of the Tree module with integrated databases that can be deployed locally or on high-performance computing clusters. Importantly, the iPhylo CLI can also construct customized taxonomic trees based on a user-defined hierarchical database so the applications of the iPhylo suite can be extended beyond biological and chemical classifications.
