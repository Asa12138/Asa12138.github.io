Many tools have been developed for biological taxonomic trees, but limitations apply, and a streamlined method for constructing chemical taxonomic trees is lacking. We present the iPhylo suite: a fully automated and interactive platform for biological and chemical taxonomic analysis. The iPhylo suite includes three modules. Two web-based modules, iPhylo Tree and iPhylo Visual, aim to streamline the workflow, encompassing tree generation, interactive tree visualization, and extensive graphic and textual annotations. A stand-alone module, iPhylo CLI, was designed for local use and high-performance computing applications and equipped with up-to-date biological and chemical taxonomic databases. "],["iphylo-tree.html", "2 iPhylo Tree 2.1 Working on the Tree page 2.2 Classification Systems", " 2 iPhylo Tree iPhylo Tree is an online web application that rapidly generates biological or chemical taxonomic trees for up to tens of thousands of organisms and chemicals within minutes. iPhylo Tree can be accessed via https://www.iphylo.net/tree, or though the Tree button on the iPhylo homepage welcome image or navigation bar. 2.1 Working on the Tree page You can easily build your tree on through the form on the tree page.

Generate Tree: Click this button to submit this form. 2.2 Classification Systems 2.2.1 Phylo Tree Phylo Tree module builds biological taxonomic trees utilizing the NCBI Taxonomy. This system enables rapid retrieval of lineage information across all domains of life. The Phylo Tree classification uses data recorded in the NCBI Taxonomy database, including TaxID, scientific name, common name, and synonyms. It currently encompasses a total of 2,388,300 TaxIDs. For more information, please refer to the official link: NCBI taxonomy database 2.2.2 Chemical Tree To meet diverse classification needs, we utilize two compound classification systems, ChemOnt and NPClassifier, for chemical taxonomies. Our database includes approximately 800,000 chemical compounds with information on IUPC names, InChiKey, InChI, isomeric SMILES, and taxonomy details. ChemOnt classifies a large number of chemicals based on their structural features. It uses chemical structures and structural features to automatically assign all known chemical compounds into a taxonomy comprising more than 4,800 different categories. NPClassifier uses machine learning models to classify natural products beyond simple chemical substructures. This system incorporates factors such as the producing organism, biosynthetic pathways, and their biological properties. For more information, please consult the official publications: ChemOnt NPClassifier "],["tree-object.html", "3 Tree Object 3.1 Taxonomic level 3.2 Branch length 3.3 Nodes 3.4 Manipulate your tree", " 3 Tree Object 3.1 Taxonomic level Biological: iPhylo trees show the taxonomic structure in 8 main taxonomic ranks: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species level of NCBI taxonomy database. If the node entered is outside of these ranks, e.g. subfamily, iPhylo will keep your node and provide the parent main rank above this rank. Chemical: iPhylo creates chemical taxonomic trees according to the classification methodology ChemOnt. The resulting chemical classification tree is organized around chemical taxonomy, starting from the highest level and descending to the lowest level: Kingdom, SuperClass, Class, SubClass, Parent Level 1, and Parent Level 2. The last two categories represent two taxonomic levels directly below SubClass. 3.2 Branch length iPhylo tree don’t contain branch length information or support value, however you can set all branch length to 1.00000 for visual clarity and subsequent analysis in external software. 3.3 Nodes All nodes in the biological tree are labeled with scientific names. The leaf nodes (the last node of each branch) of the chemical tree are labeled with ids, and the other internal nodes are labeled with compound category names, like “Glycerolipids”. Don’t worry about figuring out which compounds the ids correspond to, we’ll provide a table of correspondences. id name inchi inchikey inchikey_Planar SMILES kingdom superclass class subclass parent_level_1 parent_level_2 2055 9-SAHHDA InChI=1S/C35H68O4/c1-3-5-7-9-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-24-28-32-35(38)39-33(29-25-21-10-8-6-4-2)30-26-22-20-23-27-31-34(36)37/h33H,3-32H2,1-2H3,(H,36,37) RNTVFRIIJJCYMG-UHFFFAOYSA-N NA O=C(O)CCCCCCCC(OC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)CCCCCCCC Organic_compounds Lipids_and_lipid_like_molecules Fatty_Acyls Fatty_acids_and_conjugates Long_chain_fatty_acids NA 460647 BMP 40:2 InChI=1S/C46H87O10P/c1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-26-28-30-32-34-36-38-46(50)56-44(40-48)42-54-57(51,52)53-41-43(39-47)55-45(49)37-35-33-31-29-27-25-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-2/h15,17,19-20,43-44,47-48H,3-14,16,18,21-42H2,1-2H3,(H,51,52)/b17-15-,20-19- AAABPESZRWCLEX-YVCOGYDTSA-N NA O=C(OC(CO)COP(=O)(O)OCC(OC(=O)CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)CO)CCCCCCCCCCCC=CCC=CCCCCCCC Organic_compounds Lipids_and_lipid_like_molecules Glycerophospholipids Lysobisphosphatidic_acids NA 979858 Cer 9:0;2O/32:8 InChI=1S/C41H67NO3/c1-3-5-7-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-28-29-30-31-32-33-35-37-41(45)42-39(38-43)40(44)36-34-8-6-4-2/h5,7,10-11,13-14,16-17,19-20,22-23,25-26,28-29,39-40,43-44H,3-4,6,8-9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30-38H2,1-2H3,(H,42,45)/b7-5-,11-10-,14-13-,17-16-,20-19-,23-22-,26-25-,29-28- AAAAJZXUELYQDP-KRXQTBQASA-N NA O=C(NC(CO)C(O)CCCCCC)CCCCCCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC Organic_compounds Organic_oxygen_compounds Organooxygen_compounds Alcohols_and_polyols Secondary_alcohols NA 1013 Cer 8:1;2O/26:5 InChI=1S/C34H57NO3/c1-3-5-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-28-30-34(38)35-32(31-36)33(37)29-27-6-4-2/h5,7,9-10,12-13,15-16,18-19,27,29,32-33,36-37H,3-4,6,8,11,14,17,20-26,28,30-31H2,1-2H3,(H,35,38)/b7-5-,10-9-,13-12-,16-15-,19-18-,29-27+ QABMGQOLCJWSNA-GVWODYQASA-N NA O=C(NC(CO)C(O)C=CCCC)CCCCCCCCCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC Organic_compounds Organic_oxygen_compounds Organooxygen_compounds Alcohols_and_polyols Secondary_alcohols NA 712566 mycalamide E InChI=1S/C25H43NO10/c1-13-10-25(32-8,36-15(3)14(13)2)20(28)22(29)26-23-19-18(33-12-34-23)21(31-7)24(4,5)17(35-19)9-16(11-27)30-6/h14-21,23,27-28H,1,9-12H2,2-8H3,(H,26,29)/t14-,15-,16+,17-,18+,19+,20-,21-,23+,25-/m1/s1 AAABMNXUOFPYQK-GRMLSQNXSA-N NA C[C@H]1C@HC Organic_compounds Organoheterocyclic_compounds Pyranodioxins NA 2141 1-Cinnamoylpyrrolidine InChI=1S/C13H15NO/c15-13(14-10-4-5-11-14)9-8-12-6-2-1-3-7-12/h1-3,6-9H,4-5,10-11H2 JSIGICUAXLIURX-UHFFFAOYSA-N NA O=C(C=CC=1C=CC=CC1)N2CCCC2 Organic_compounds Phenylpropanoids_and_polyketides Cinnamic_acids_and_derivatives NA 3.4 Manipulate your tree 3.4.1 Interrupt Use the Interrupt at check box to interrupt the extension of a tree branch at any specific taxonomy level. This function will significantly avoid the formation of excessively large trees with an overwhelming number of nodes. Example 4 from Phylo Tree is used as an example: Before interrupt: _____ ____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Drosophila_melanogaster | _____ ____| _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Mus_musculus | | ____| | |_____| |_____ ____ _____ _____ s__Homo_sapiens ______| | | |____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Gallus_gallus | |_____ ____ _____ ____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Escherichia_coli After interrupt (at Phylum level): ______________ p__Chordata ______________ ______________| ________________| |______________ p__Arthropoda | |______________ ______________ ______________ p__Proteobacteria 3.4.2 Sub-tree You can quickly obtain a full-clade tree for any taxonomic level using the operator |subtree. The resulting sub-tree comprises the common ancestor and all its descendants in the specified clade. For example: Primates|subtree Liliaceae|subtree This feature in chemical classification tree needs to input the chemical category names as the prefixes. For example: Hydroxyindoles|subtree Pentalenes|subtree Organophosphorus compounds|subtree "],["input-output.html", "4 Input &amp; Output 4.1 Input 4.2 Output", " 4 Input &amp; Output 4.1 Input 4.1.1 Input elements You can use the following element types, or any combination of them. Biological elements should be separated by commas or newlines. Chemical elements should be separated by newlines to prevent potential misinterpretation of names due to commas. 4.1.2 Biological Organism names: The names are flexible as long as they are indexed in the NCBI taxonomic database, such as “scientific name”, “synonym”, or “common name”. For example, “human” can serve as the common name for “Homo sapiens”. All leaf nodes within the iPhylo trees will be their corresponding scientific name. You can see how name changed in the output text file. For instance: honey bee -&gt; Apis mellifera house mouse -&gt; Mus musculus human -&gt; Homo sapiens Taxonomy identifiers (taxid) Subtree: Follows the format “xxx|subtree”, see details in Sub-tree. 4.1.3 Chemical InChIKey: The InChIKey is a fixed length (27 character) condensed digital representation of the InChI that is not designed to be human-understandable. We strongly recommend using the InChIKey to represent chemicals in the chemical tree online module, which utilizes the chemonline.py from the ClassyFire API in iPhylo CLI, due to its unique and concise nature. For example: VXRWAWLEFDIKKA-NGVUZZMQSA-N JWUMPSYUUYOAEP-GLYJLXGFSA-N PLYVHUNKJZPXRH-RCNNPCQASA-N isomeric SMILES The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. This format is highly recommended for use in the chemical tree online module, which employs the NPonline.py from the NPClassifier API in iPhylo CLI. For example: O=C(NC(COC1OC(CO)C(OC2OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O)C(O)C=CCCC=CCCC=CCCCCCC)CCCCCCCCC=CCC=CCC=CCC=CCC InChI The International Chemical Identifier (InChI) is a textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to be structure-based, strictly unique, and non-proprietary. For example: InChI=1S/C23H25N5O5/c1-30-18-11-14-15(12-19(18)31-2)25-23(26-21(14)24)28-9-7-27(8-10-28)22(29)20-13-32-16-5-3-4-6-17(16)33-20/h3-6,11-12,20H,7-10,13H2,1-2H3,(H2,24,25,26)/t20-/m1/s1 Subtree: Follows the format “xxx|subtree”, see details in Sub-tree. 4.2 Output 4.2.1 Tree file iPhylo can generate trees in the following formats: Newick, Nexus, and PhyloXML. Newick Format: Description: Newick, also known as New Hampshire or New Hampshire Extended format, is a simple and widely used text-based format for representing phylogenetic trees. It expresses tree structures using nested parentheses and commas. Example: (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5); Usage: It’s commonly used for representing hierarchical relationships in evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. Nexus Format: Description: Nexus is a versatile file format that can store various types of biological data, including phylogenetic trees. It allows the inclusion of metadata, DNA/protein sequences, and more. It is both human-readable and writable. Example: #NEXUS Begin trees; Tree myTree = (A,B,(C,D)); End; Usage: Nexus is often used in phylogenetics, systematics, and evolutionary biology due to its flexibility. PhyloXML: Description: PhyloXML is an XML-based format designed to store and exchange phylogenetic trees and associated data. It supports a variety of information, including node labels, branch lengths, and annotations. Example: &lt;phylogeny&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;A&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.1&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;B&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.2&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;C&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.3&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;D&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.4&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;/phylogeny&gt; Usage: PhyloXML is suitable for storing and sharing complex phylogenetic data, often used in bioinformatics. Phylip Format: Description: The Phylip (PHYLogeny Inference Package) format is a simple, line-based format developed for use with the Phylip software package. It is used to represent both sequence data and phylogenetic trees. Example: 4 A 0.0 0.1 0.2 B 0.1 0.0 0.3 C 0.2 0.3 0.0 D 0.3 0.2 0.1 Usage: Phylip format is commonly used for input and output in phylogenetic analysis software and tools. These formats cater to different needs, from simple tree representations to more complex structures with additional metadata. The choice of format often depends on the specific requirements of the analysis or tool being used. 4.2.2 Tree structure visualizations ASCII Tree: Simple pretty-printing of your tree structures using pure ASCII characters for drawing branches and edges. For instance: _____ ____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Drosophila_melanogaster | _____ ____| _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Mus_musculus | | ____| | |_____| |_____ ____ _____ _____ s__Homo_sapiens ______| | | |____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Gallus_gallus | |_____ ____ _____ ____ _____ ____ _____ _____ s__Escherichia_coli Simple tree plot: The phylograph in PDF format, with clades colored by phyla or superclass. Plots are drawn using ggtree For instance: Rectangular Plot Circular Plot 4.2.3 Additional files When running iPhylo, we generate some other files to help you understand the tree better: iphylo_tree_items.csv, ichem_tree_items.csv These spreadsheet enlist the taxID (id for chemicals), scientific name (name, InChI, InChIKey, SMILES for chemicals) and lineage for the taxa you input. iphylo_tree_items_for_anno.csv Similar to iphylo_tree_items.csv, but tailored for iPhylo Visual, serves as an annotation for basic visualization of tree leaves. It can be directly uploaded to iPhylo Visual for enhanced visualization and annotation. no_match_result.txt This file is used to alert you when you have input taxIDs and names that are not in the NCBI taxonomy database, or when you have input a name that corresponds to more than one taxID. Note that the taxID is the unique identifier for NCBI taxonomy database entries. In the case of chemical trees, this file is used to indicate which compounds are not in the iPhylo database or are missing classification information. Our database mainly contains functional compounds, if you want more more compounds information, try our iPhylo CLI chemoline module. "],["integration-with-iphylo-visual.html", "5 Integration with iPhylo Visual", " 5 Integration with iPhylo Visual After generating the tree, clicking the VISUALIZE button opens a new iPhylo Visual page, automatically importing the generated tree and leaf annotation file. In the Main panel, simply click the Go button on the page to display the tree’s graphical representation without the need for additional file uploads.

The iPhylo Visual also offers the convenience of saving and uploading work sessions locally, as well as access to source codes for plotting and annotating. The iPhylo Visual leverages the full graphical capabilities of ggtree1 and ggtreeExtra2 for visualizing, manipulating, and annotating tree-structured data. The iPhylo Visual is an interactive online tool designed to facilitate the display, annotation, and inspection of tree-based structures, including but not limited to phylogenetic and chemical taxonomic trees generated from iPhylo modules. The iPhylo Visual simplifies the process of annotating taxonomic trees by adopting a data frame-compatible format, enabling users to encapsulate all required information within one data frame for leaf annotation and one data frame for node annotation, respectively. Within the data frame, rows correspond to tree nodes, and columns represent specific features. Users can efficiently navigate and manage these uploaded data frames through the provided online table viewer, with sorting and retrieval capabilities. This design avoids uploading multiple annotation files and is directly compatible with R. Guangchuang Yu. Using ggtree to visualize data on tree-like structures.

Example: #NEXUS Begin trees; Tree myTree = (A,B,(C,D)); End; Usage: Nexus is often used in phylogenetics, systematics, and evolutionary biology due to its flexibility. PhyloXML: Description: PhyloXML is an XML-based format designed to store and exchange phylogenetic trees and associated data. It supports a variety of information, including node labels, branch lengths, and annotations. Example: &lt;phylogeny&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;A&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.1&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;B&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.2&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;C&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.3&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;clade&gt; &lt;name&gt;D&lt;/name&gt; &lt;branch_length&gt;0.4&lt;/branch_length&gt; &lt;/clade&gt; &lt;/phylogeny&gt; Usage: PhyloXML is suitable for storing and sharing complex phylogenetic data, often used in bioinformatics. Phylip Format: Description: The Phylip (PHYLogeny Inference Package) format is a simple, line-based format developed for use with the Phylip software package. It is used to represent both sequence data and phylogenetic trees. Example: 4 A 0.0 0.1 0.2 B 0.1 0.0 0.3 C 0.2 0.3 0.0 D 0.3 0.2 0.1 Usage: Phylip format is commonly used for input and output in phylogenetic analysis software and tools. These formats cater to different needs, from simple tree representations to more complex structures with additional metadata. The choice of format often depends on the specific requirements of the analysis or tool being used. 10.1.2 Leaf annotation Click the Browse button to upload a leaf annotation file with the ,, \\t, or ; separators: When preparing your leaf annotation file, follow these guidelines for proper formatting: Column Names: The first column must be named “id” and corresponds to the identifiers of the leaves in your tree. ID Repetition: IDs can be repeated for multiple annotations. Any ID not matching a leaf in the tree will be ignored. Avoid Reserved Columns: Do not include built-in column names such as “parent,” “node,” “branch.length,” “label,” “isTip,” “x,” “y,” “branch,” and “angle.” Example: Suppose you have a tree with the following leaf IDs: Leaf 1: “A” Leaf 2: “B” Leaf 3: “C” Your leaf annotation file should look like this: id,annotation1,annotation2 A,value1,infoA B,value2,infoB C,value3,infoC A,value4,infoD B,value5,infoE In this example, “id” corresponds to the leaf IDs in your tree, and you can add multiple annotations for each leaf. Columns beyond “id” can be used to provide additional information for each leaf. 10.1.3 Node annotation Click the Browse button to upload a node annotation file with the ,, \\t, or ; separators: When preparing your node annotation file, follow these guidelines for proper formatting: Column Names: The first column must be named “id” and corresponds to the identifiers of the leaves in your tree. ID Repetition: IDs can be repeated for multiple annotations. Any ID not matching a node in the tree will be ignored. Avoid Reserved Columns: Do not include built-in column names such as “parent,” “node,” “branch.length,” “label,” “isTip,” “x,” “y,” “branch,” and “angle.” Example: Suppose you have a tree with the following internal node IDs: Internal Node 1: “N1” Internal Node 2: “N2” Internal Node 3: “N3” Your leaf annotation file should look like this: id,annotationX,annotationY N1,valueX1,valueY1 N2,valueX2,valueY2 N3,valueX3,valueY3 N1,valueX4,valueY4 N2,valueX5,valueY5 In this example, “id” corresponds to the internal node IDs in your tree, and you can add multiple annotations for each node. Columns beyond “id” can be used to provide additional information for each node. Remember, the correct file format and adherence to the mentioned guidelines will ensure successful annotation. 10.1.4 Session To restore your work and retrieve your saved data, you can use the Upload Session component to upload the session file with the “.iphylo” extension. The iPhylo Visual emphasizes the ease of exporting and replicating tree displays using the work session files. The unique exported “.iphylo” files pack all essential data for generating trees with iPhylo. These files are extremely compact, with a size of 30kB for a well-annotated tree of 1000 species. All tree-annotation sessions can be saved to and uploaded from the local computer, enabling the users to fine-tune complex trees while maintaining control over the original data. Moreover, the session files can facilitate cooperative annotation projects. 10.2 Export 10.2.1 Export image iPhylo Visual provides different image export formats for trees, namely, PNG, PDF, and JPEG. 10.2.2 Save session iPhylo Visual offers a session saving feature that allows you to save your work at any point during the annotation process. Simply click the Save Session button to save your data and selected options for the current page. 10.2.3 Download R scripts Importantly, iPhylo Visual’s Export Code feature exports all the raw data and plotting code for the visualized and annotated tree in one click. The package includes the tree file, the annotation table, detailed annotation parameters recorded in a JSON file, and an R script for visualizing the data: By running this script locally (source main.R), users can replicate the tree visualization as seen in iPhylo Visual. Advanced users proficient with R programming can further customize the tree by modifying the code.
